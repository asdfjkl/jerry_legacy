Bugs/Important Issues
- - - - - - - - - - -

- testing of game analysis
 
- bug: don't insert var with same move

- bug: possible to enter move in analysis
  via board

- bug: won't switch back to enter
  moves after analysis

- testing in general; code refactoring
  removing printers, more comments

- edit game data when pasting


Long Term Roadmap
- - - - - - - - - - -

- eco classification

- load full pgn files, not just first game

- engine output should show SAN or
  full algebraic notation, not 
  raw engine output

- FICS/ICC support

- use more frequently statusbar for messages

- computer: draw acceptance (either worse or equal,
  but at least some moves played!)
