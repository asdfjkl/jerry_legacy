Bugs/Important Issues/General Issues
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
to be fixed before Version 2.0

- "reset" to get init pos in edit menu

- check jpg extension (similar to pgn) when saving position as image

- priority level of qprocess: currently doesn't work on windows due to qt bug
  solution: port to pyqt5

- LATER (current saving of strength level and
  handling of game info is ugly, though)
  for reset strength level in analysis mode

- LATER: responsiveness in analysis mode
  is this really an issue, when engine process
  is set to be lower than gui?

- testing in general; code refactoring
  removing printers, more comments

Version 2.0
- - - - - -

* internationalization: +German, +Japanese
  for menus and config (but either keep SAN in english,
  or replace for gui with symbols)

* Game Browser for PGN files below main window
  should have various filter search options, e.g.
  filter by all header tags of pgn, (and probably
  step by step moves?)
  needs some indexer for large pgn databases

* ECO classification for new/loaded games

* timed games

* ability to switch (for analysis) to another
  game engine

* choose your own board colors

... and probably some of the next ones:
