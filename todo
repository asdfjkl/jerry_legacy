- render pgn annotations for gui instead
  of displaying raw numbers
- DONE fix enter position 
- DONE offer draw
- DONE resign
- DONE computer resigns (nicer message box?)
- DONE computer offers draw (but crude)
- DONE strength level dialog (both sliders)

- DONE evaluation should always be from
       white's perspective
- DONE make engineoutput non editable

- DONE set game data (who is player etc)
       on new game

- LATER: eco classification

- DONE show always eval (update info only)

- DONE automatic draws due to various rules
  (check by python-chess api calls)
  included: threefold repetition, checkmate, stalemate
  more complex fide-rules will not be included (useless in practice)

- DONE (needs testing) always save current
  state (game, board,
  strength setting etc.) on exit

- DONE stockfish filename selction dependent on os

- DONE play out position (maybe later?)

- DONE full game analysis

- full game analysis: 
  - stop at book
  - start with dialog (start end move numer, threshold)

- DONE opening book

- LATER engine output should show SAN or
  full algebraic notation, not 
  raw engine output

- DONE engine should be started with given
  parameter from main.py

- DONE save scrollstate in movesedit

- DONE (by extending chess.pgn)
  rewrite printer iteratively, since recursion
  crashes with game of more than 200 moves

- DONE (just use pickle instead)
  rewrite find_node of gamestate (must be faster
  for games with more than 200 moves)

- DONE shortcuts

- LATER (currently only version)
  statusbar for message

- LATER refactor: most functionality
  of menus in main (controller)
  controller contols directly

  boardview and movesview emit
  emit signals if they detect changes

  separate functions of controller
  in different files/modules, probably w.r.t.
  menu (no need for classes)

- testing/bugfixings
  esp. editing/loading game (data)
  and gs.game gs.root gs.current etc.

- computer offers draw too early
  (should be: only after xx moves)
  (should the computer ever offer draw?)

- edit game data when pasting
