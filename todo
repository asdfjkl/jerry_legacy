- DONE fix enter position 
- DONE offer draw
- DONE resign
- DONE computer resigns (nicer message box?)
- DONE computer offers draw (but crude)
- DONE strength level dialog (both sliders)

- DONE evaluation should always be from
       white's perspective
- DONE make engineoutput non editable

- DONE set game data (who is player etc)
       on new game

- LATER: eco classification

- DONE show always eval (update info only)

- DONE automatic draws due to various rules
  (check by python-chess api calls)
  included: threefold repetition, checkmate, stalemate
  more complex fide-rules will not be included (useless in practice)

- DONE (partial, only saves game but not current position)
  always save current state (game, board,
  strength setting etc.) on exit

- play out position (maybe later?)

- full game analysis

- DONE opening book

- LATER engine output should show SAN or
  full algebraic notation, not 
  raw engine output

- DONE engine should be started with given
  parameter from main.py

- shortcuts

- statusbar for message

- editing/loading game (data)

- LATER refactor: most functionality
  of menus in main (controller)
  controller contols directly

  boardview and movesview emit
  emit signals if they detect changes

  separate functions of controller
  in different files/modules, probably w.r.t.
  menu (no need for classes)

- testing/bugfixings
