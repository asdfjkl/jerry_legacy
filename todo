- remove _all_ printers

- add "cache" with text repr. of each game node

- add bool trigger redraw to each game node

- rewrite gui printer with that

- play as black not working

- check jpg extension (similar to pgn) when saving position as image

- colon/spacing with current move in display window

- priority level of qprocess: currently doesn't work on windows due to qt bug
  solution: port to pyqt5

- LATER (current saving of strength level and
  handling of game info is ugly, though)
  for reset strength level in analysis mode

- LATER: responsiveness in analysis mode
  is this really an issue, when engine process
  is set to be lower than gui?

- crash when quickly changing between analysis and enter moves mode

- testing in general; code refactoring
  removing printers, more comments

- san instead of fan in analysis window

- mate#0; don't display anything except checkmate in analysis window

- drag and drop pgns

- register with pgn's, ability to "open with"

- a "reset board" function in edit.

- hide moves up until played (for training)
