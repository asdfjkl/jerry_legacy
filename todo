  (current saving of strength level and
   handling of game info is ugly, though)

Long Term Roadmap
- - - - - - - - - - -

- width of messagebox according to message

- eco classification

- load full pgn files, not just first game

- engine output should show SAN or
  full algebraic notation, not 
  raw engine output

- FICS/ICC support

- use more frequently statusbar for messages

- computer: draw acceptance (either worse or equal,
  but at least some moves played!)
