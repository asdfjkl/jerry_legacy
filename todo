ver 2 alpha, bug list
---------------------

- castling rights in 12.5 (enter position)
- spaces in engine path on windows
- japanese translation

- bug when loading game snd time
- focus lost when clicking on analysis window       [done]
- switching to analysis mode after game analysis
- offering draw and resigning not working           [done]
- on_enter_moves_mode wasn't called before          [done]
  browsing database
- performance issue on old computer systems:
  information processing too slow
  prob. due to GIL, i.e. python code that processes
  output of engine in qthread "fights" with GUI


todo before releasing alpha:

- windows: automatic identification of 32/64 bit    [done]
- complete translation to German and Japanese       [done, verified, need to update jap]

-------

Bug (dev):

- DONE handle deletion of current game in browse_dialog

- ensure "Save" is really only enabled when it makes sense

- replace pickle with json

- DONE saving db index and reloading (by checking integrity) on startup

- add maximal game limit (1024 games?) for pgn files

- bug: offsets when deleting/updating last game

- change gamestate only if real edits happen, not just moving back and forth

- FIXED if game is loaded from fen, 1. is missing at first move

- file is game or file is database?
  probably add database menu?!

Bugs of 1.01
------------

- test with uci option "spy" on windows(!)

- FIXED when moving a variant up/down, redraw is not correctly
  triggered (main variant looks like: [8.0-0 8...Nf6])

- show depth

Bugs/Important Issues/General Issues
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
to be fixed before Version 2.0

- "reset" to get init pos in edit menu

- check jpg extension (similar to pgn) when saving position as image

- priority level of qprocess: currently doesn't work on windows due to qt bug
  solution: port to pyqt5

- LATER (current saving of strength level and
  handling of game info is ugly, though)
  for reset strength level in analysis mode

- LATER: responsiveness in analysis mode
  is this really an issue, when engine process
  is set to be lower than gui?

- testing in general; code refactoring
  removing printers, more comments

Version 2.0
- - - - - -

* internationalization: +German, +Japanese
  for menus and config (but either keep SAN in english,
  or replace for gui with symbols)

* Game Browser for PGN files below main window
  should have various filter search options, e.g.
  filter by all header tags of pgn, (and probably
  step by step moves?)
  needs some indexer for large pgn databases

* ECO classification for new/loaded games

* timed games

* ability to switch (for analysis) to another
  game engine

* choose your own board colors

... and probably some of the next ones:
