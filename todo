Bugs/Important Issues
- - - - - - - - - - -

- game analysis was finished bug: switch to analysis instead
  of enter moves
  -> can't reproduce.

- 1.) remember save directory

- 2.) if save path is known, target save_as directory there

- remove printers

- move variant up, down
- delete variant: set current to last before variant start

- priority level of qprocess: currently doesn't work on windows due to qt bug

- LATER (current saving of strength level and
  handling of game info is ugly, though)
  for reset strength level in analysis mode

- LATER: responsiveness in analysis mode
  is this really an issue, when engine process
  is set to be lower than gui?

- testing in general; code refactoring
  removing printers, more comments


Long Term Roadmap
- - - - - - - - - - -

- multiple uci engines

- drag and drop pgns

- a "reset board" function in edit.

- hide moves up until played (for training)

- width of messagebox according to message

- eco classification

- load full pgn files, not just first game

- engine output should show SAN or
  full algebraic notation, not 
  raw engine output

- FICS/ICC support

- use more frequently statusbar for messages

- computer: draw acceptance (either worse or equal,
  but at least some moves played!)
