Bugs/Important Issues
- - - - - - - - - - -

- disable save dir after enter position

- messages: title + informative line looks strange on win
  (maybe just one textline)

- remove printers

- priority level of qprocess: currently doesn't work on windows due to qt bug
  solution: port to pyqt5

- LATER (current saving of strength level and
  handling of game info is ugly, though)
  for reset strength level in analysis mode

- LATER: responsiveness in analysis mode
  is this really an issue, when engine process
  is set to be lower than gui?

- testing in general; code refactoring
  removing printers, more comments

- san instead of fan in analysis window


Long Term Roadmap
- - - - - - - - - - -

- choose the side for game analysis

- different player profiles

- ability to draw arrows/other graphical annotations

- textual commentary(?)

- multiple uci engines

- drag and drop pgns

- register with pgn's, ability to "open with"

- a "reset board" function in edit.

- hide moves up until played (for training)

- width of messagebox according to message

- eco classification

- load full pgn files, not just first game

- engine output should show SAN or
  full algebraic notation, not 
  raw engine output

- FICS/ICC support

- internationalization

- use more frequently statusbar for messages

- idee: animationen bei zügen mit vor/zurück (vlt. sogar double-buffering?)

- various skins

- calculate (pseudo elo) rating when playing against computer like shredder
